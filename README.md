# FRC 7617 Maven Repo

A Maven repository containing the vendor libraries created by FRC team 7617.

These libraries are updated by calls to the update workflow, which is triggered by a `repository_dispatch` signal from the source repository. They are then pushed to GitHub Pages so they can be downloaded through their library's vendordep.
